# Game Manual

## Introduction
Meshal Lite is a game rule designed for co - creating adventure stories, emphasizing simplicity and fast - paced gameplay. With this game rule, you and your friends can create and play vivid characters, explore secrets, uncover truths, challenge enemies or various monsters in different game worlds, and even influence the political situation within the game world. Meshal Lite is applicable to most game worlds. For example, you can hunt and farm in a primitive world to find survival resources for your tribe; play an extraordinary hero in a mythical era and fight against legendary monsters; or play a chivalrous knight or a shadowy assassin in the Middle Ages, fighting for your mission and beliefs. Similarly, you can play an agent in the modern world and participate in the undercurrents of espionage battles; or as an explorer visiting unknown planets during upcoming interstellar voyages - all of this depends on the imagination of you and your game partners. Before playing with Meshal Lite, you should understand the following elements:

### Players and Host
As a player, you will play the game with other players. Usually, each player controls one (or more) game characters. You can control your game character to live, adventure, grow, and fight in the game world. Outside the game, you are the soul of the game character, and your thoughts determine everything the character does in the game world.

The host is the arbiter of the entire game and the narrator of the story, equivalent to a "super - player". As the host, you control all non - player characters to interact or oppose the players, set up challenges, or guide the players deeper into the plot and conspiracy. In the game, the host decides the plot development according to the players' actions and judges the results of these actions (even secretly manipulating the results by rolling dice when necessary). Usually, when there is a dispute in the game, the host often has the final ruling power.

### Relationship
In the game world, you will encounter various enemies, as well as partners who offer help for different reasons, but more often, you will meet strangers who have nothing to do with you. Relationships are not static: you may hurt a former friend and turn against them; or you may become friends with someone you hit it off with after a fight; sometimes, old opponents may also join forces to fight against a more powerful enemy.

#### Friendly
Creatures that are friendly to you will always offer you help, give you gifts, and provide assistance. Usually, a friendly relationship is only considered when both parties recognize each other. Usually, player characters playing together are mostly considered to have a friendly relationship.

#### Neutral
Although neutral creatures do not hostile you, they usually do not help you either. In fact, as long as you do not harm the interests of neutral creatures, they do not care what you do.

#### Hostile
Characters who intend to harm you are regarded as hostile, such as the two sides fighting desperately on the battlefield, or opponents who prevent you from achieving your goals.

### Rules
In the game, you may encounter situations not mentioned in the rules - and sometimes, although the rules do state how to handle relevant situations, you and your game partners may not be able to find these rule entries for a while. These situations may cause disputes. Please remember that the game rules are designed to create a pleasant game, so a flexible understanding of the rules will make the game smoother. If a dispute occurs, please discuss the solution with your game partners. Always keep in mind that the game rules are only for the game, and do not lose precious friendships because you are too involved in the game - **the rules are not that important, and fun is the soul of the game!**

#### Basic Rules
In Meshal Lite, only the most necessary parts are retained as the main body of the rules to interpret the most common game processes and situations. The basic rules are listed in this rule manual and are the general rules for playing the game. Of course, in many cases, game elements such as expansion rules, customized rules, various features, abilities, and items may contain special cases outside the basic rules. Please note that the basic rules are only used to handle the "blank" parts outside the special cases. Therefore, if a special case conflicts with the basic rules, always follow the provisions of the special case.

#### Alternative Rules
The alternative rules are supplements to the basic rules. They are appropriately added on the basis of the basic rules to provide a more realistic or strategic game process. Before each alternative rule, "[Alternative]" will be marked to indicate it. The host and players can freely decide which alternative rules to adopt in the game. Usually, if an alternative rule conflicts with the basic rules, always follow the alternative rule. In addition, customized rules or special cases in other game elements will take precedence over the alternative rules.

#### Customized Rules
When playing the game, the host and players can also fully exert their creativity to create unique customized rules, or customize new game elements (such as creating new races, new items, or abilities), or even subvert all the original elements and create completely different game rules and story styles. Please note that if a customized rule conflicts with the basic or alternative rules, always follow the customized rule.

### How to Play
During the entire game process, the host and players jointly follow the following three main links, taking turns to advance the game:

#### Describe Environment
As the host of the game, you can describe the game world in any way you can think of, telling the players the situation they are in. This includes the players' location (such as being in a secret room, in a narrow corridor, in a small border village, etc.), time (such as ten years after the last war, when the sun has not fully risen in the morning, before the main course of the dinner is served), and the obvious things around (such as a minecart track leading straight to the depth of the cave, a calm noble sitting at the end of a long dining table, dots of faint light flickering in the server room, etc.). The description of the environment often depends on the host's game style. Some hosts may be concise, only making a general description of the surrounding environment, leaving enough room for the players' imagination; while others may describe everything in detail, even with pictures and delicate props, so that the players can have a concrete understanding of the environment. Whichever style it is, it should ensure that the players can master the most basic information: "Where am I" and "What is here".

#### Declare Actions
Based on the host's description, players can make their characters take actions. For example, open the iron gate to the north, hide in the shadows of the corner, attack the opponent with the weapon in hand, etc. - you can declare any logical action. In the game, three time spans are commonly used: briefing, narrative, and moment process. The description of actions varies in different processes: the briefing process is suitable for general actions (such as taking a long - term rest, traveling from one city to another); the narrative process is suitable for daily actions or a set of actions (such as investigating the decorations in the room, inquiring with the bartender in the tavern); the moment process is like the slow - motion in a movie, where characters alternately take actions within the same short period of time (such as dodging and moving in a flurry of swords and shadows, advancing alternately under a hail of bullets). Usually, both players and the host should specifically describe the actions of their respective characters and ensure to provide the most basic information: "Who", "What target", and "What action".

#### Determine Results
After the player declares their action, the host often needs to judge the result of the action. Some simple actions will directly get results (such as getting on a minecart, pushing open an unlocked door, picking up an item), but if this action has difficulty (such as lifting a heavy rock, cracking a combination lock) or has a chance of failure (such as wrestling with an opponent, shooting at a distant target), then dice need to be rolled to determine the result. After getting the result in any way, the host should describe the result of the action - a wonderful description will render the game atmosphere, making the game process as exciting as an epic; while a concise description can also make the plot compact and crisp, like an action drama that keeps you on the edge of your seat. In short, players understand the results of their actions through these descriptions, and these results often lead to the subsequent game plot or create more possibilities (for example, after the player decides to open the iron gate to the north, the host should describe the environment behind the iron gate), thus returning the game link to the step of describing the environment, and so on in a cycle.

### Common Calculations
In the game, usually only some of the most basic mathematical knowledge is needed, such as four arithmetic operations, comparing sizes, etc.

#### Expressions
In the game, you may use four arithmetic operations: + for addition, - for subtraction, ร for multiplication, and รท for division. The same as the mathematical knowledge learned in school: always multiply and divide first, then add and subtract, and calculate the part in parentheses first. Sometimes, you may encounter a situation where it cannot be divided evenly (such as 3รท2 = 1.5), usually the decimal part is always discarded when getting the final result (such as 1.5 is rounded to 1).

#### Take Higher and Take Lower
Take Higher means you will take the highest number among multiple numbers, and Take Lower means you will take the lowest number among multiple numbers.

#### Deviation
If you need to calculate the difference between two numbers, subtract the lower number from the higher number, and the resulting value is the deviation.

### Dice Rolling
In the game, you often need to roll dice and determine the result of an action or event according to the result of the dice roll. All dice rolling in the game only requires a six - sided die. When you encounter instructions such as "3๐" or "Might Dice๐ฝ", you need to roll the specified number of dice and calculate the result: roll the dice as required, and when the dice stop, the number on the upward - facing side of each die is the result of the dice roll.

Sometimes, you need to calculate before rolling the dice - you should first calculate the part before the symbol ๐ or ๐ฝ to get the number of dice required for the dice roll. For example, when rolling 4 + 3๐, you need to roll 4+3 = 7 dice. Please note that if the number of dice to be rolled โค 0, it means the result of this dice roll must be 0.

#### Dice
In the game, the dice you use are all six - sided dice (commonly known as D6), with each face marked with numbers from 1 to 6.

#### Points / ๐
After rolling the dice, a die with the number 1 is 1 point, a die with the number 2 is 2 points, and the rest of the dice are 0 points. The dice roll for obtaining points is represented by "๐". For example, "3๐" means rolling 3 dice and counting their points; "Might Dice๐" means you need to roll your Might Dice and count the points.

> Kereda needs to roll 4๐. He rolls 4 dice and gets the numbers 3, 1, 2, and 6. Count the numbers of this dice roll: record the die with the number 1 as 1 point, the die with the number 2 as 2 points, and the other 2 dice as 0 points. Therefore, Kereda gets 0 + 1+2 + 0 = 3 points as the result of this dice roll.

#### Number / ๐ฝ
After rolling the dice, add up the numbers of all the dice to get the result of the die face. The dice roll for obtaining the die - face number is represented by "๐ฝ". For example, "2๐ฝ" means rolling 2 dice and calculating the sum of the numbers; "Agility Dice๐ฝ" means you need to roll your Agility Dice and calculate the sum of the numbers. The dice roll for obtaining the die - face number is often used to calculate larger numerical results, such as initiative ranking, calculating the results of bargaining, and measuring the quantity of supplies.

> At the beginning of the battle, Trinity rolls Agility Dice๐ฝ to determine her initiative. She has 6 Agility Dice. After rolling them, she gets the numbers 2, 3, 3, 4, 1, and 5. She adds up these dice numbers to get 2 + 3+3 + 4+1 + 5 = 18. Therefore, Trinity gets 18 as the result.

As the dice - roller, you can also actively reduce the number of dice used for the dice roll. This kind of decision is usually used for holding back, but you cannot reduce the result of the dice roll. For example, when interrogating a prisoner, you control the force of your punches (reduce the number of dice rolled), but you may still accidentally knock the opponent unconscious due to lack of control (still rolling 2 points). If you reduce the number of dice rolled to 0, it means you give up this dice roll. When rolling the dice, you should roll all the dice used for the dice roll at once - rolling the dice in batches will make the game process seemๆๆฒ, and it also้พๅ has the suspicion of playing with fate.

#### Attemption and Difficulty
When you try to achieve a difficult goal (such as trying to push open a heavy door, maintaining balance when crossing a single - plank bridge, or distinguishing a fake), you need to roll the dice to attempt. Each attempt needs to be compared with the difficulty of this thing: if the result of the dice roll > difficulty, then the attempt is considered successful, otherwise it is considered a failure. The minimum difficulty is 0. Even if the difficulty of a certain attempt drops below 0 due to various factors, in the game, you should still regard it as 0.

For some complex attempts that take a long time to complete, the host often allows you to accumulate the results of the dice roll (such as deciphering a ciphertext document, investing and trading in the financial market, or invading an operating system under multiple firewalls). This kind of attempt is called a Progressive Attemption: you can roll the dice in each attempt cycle and accumulate the results until the total result > difficulty, then it is considered successful. If a Progressive Attemption has no time limit, then this attempt can usually be successful eventually. The host can choose to omit the cumbersome dice - rolling and only calculate the time used for this attempt - use difficulty ร 2รท number of dice rolled ร time of each attempt, and you will get the time spent on this Progressive Attemption.

> A stone door stands in front of Aidoff. This door is made of a complete huge rock, thick and solid.

Aidoff: "I try to push this stone door hard."

The host asks Aidoff to roll Might Dice๐ (difficulty 5), and Aidoff rolls 3.

The host: "You push the stone door hard, but it is too thick. Even if you try your best, you can't move it at all."

Aidoff: "Then, I want to check if there are any mechanisms around this door to drive it."

The host asks Aidoff to roll Spirit Dice๐ (difficulty 1), and Aidoff rolls 2. He finds a palm - sized stone plate on one side of the stone door, with nine quail - egg - sized pebbles regularly arranged on the plate. Obviously, this is a password mechanism, but Aidoff doesn't know what order to use to crack it.

Aidoff: "I will try repeatedly until I crack the password."

So, the host asks Aidoff to roll Spirit Dice - 3๐ once every minute for the attempt (since he has no idea about the password, 3 dice will be reduced for each dice roll). This attempt will continue until the cumulative points exceed the difficulty of 30. After dozens of minutes, Aidoff finally accumulates enough points to exceed the difficulty and tries out the correct password.

| Difficulty | Difficulty Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | An attempt with no difficulty. As long as you are not too careless, you can usually succeed. To speed up the game process, the host can directly judge such attempts as successful. Examples: lifting a table, using a wrench to turn a nut, mental arithmetic of addition and subtraction. |
| 1 - 2 | An easy attempt, but it requires stable skills and a little luck. Examples: breaking an apple with bare hands, maintaining balance on a single - plank bridge, identifying a common symbol. |
| 3 - 4 | This kind of attempt requires certain skills and talents, or some good luck. Examples: pushing a heavy stone door, jumping up and catching a frisbee in mid - air, spotting a specific face in a crowd at a glance. |
| 5 - 6 | Unless you have a high talent, you need excellent professional ability to complete this attempt. Examples: overthrowing a huge stone statue, performing stunts while skiing, solving an unpopular math problem. |
| 7 - 8 | Only through strict training, extraordinary performance, and firm will can you achieve this attempt. Examples: breaking the shackles that bind you, stealing the sword from the guard's hand, finding the traces left by the prey after a whole day of heavy rain. |
| 9 or higher | Ordinary people usually cannot achieve this kind of attempt. Even a powerful hero needs the favor of good luck to complete it. Examples: stopping a speeding vehicle with bare hands, running on the outer wall of a high - rise building and landing safely, identifying a long - lost rune. |

#### Contestation
Sometimes you need to compete with an opponent (such as arm - wrestling, bargaining during a transaction). At this time, the characters participating in the competition need to roll the dice respectively, and the one with the higher result will win this competition. If the results are the same, it is regarded as a tie.

If a competition takes a long time to decide the winner (such as chasing each other, conducting a litigation debate), then the Progressive Contestation method can be used: the competitors accumulate the results of the dice roll respectively, and the one who reaches the agreed number first will win the competition.

#### Assist
In some situations, you can assist others' attempts or competitions. The host can decide how to calculate the result of the assist dice roll according to the specific situation:
 - For actions that can improve efficiency through joint efforts (such as jointly pushing a heavy stone door), the assistant can accumulate their dice - roll result into the assisted person's dice - roll result.
 - For actions that require precise operation and rely on technology and knowledge theory (such as solving a math puzzle), the higher result of the assistant and the assisted person's dice - roll is taken.
